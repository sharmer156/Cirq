class DepolarizerChannel(object):
    """Depolarizing Channel Transformer for error simulation.

    This class simulates errors in a quantum circuit by randomly
    introducing error gates in between each moment.  This simulates
    noise by decohering random qubits at each step.  This transform
    is intended only for classical simulations only.

    This class currently defaults to adding a Pauli-Z gate at
    each step but the gate set to add is configurable.  Note that
    all gates must be XmonGates or have a half_turns parameter
    that will be overwritten by this class with a parameterized
    value.

    If the job already contains a parameter sweep, this will create
    the error sweep as a cartesian product (i.e. a "factor") of the
    existing parameter sweep.  For example, if the job contains a
    parameter with 4 values, the new job will run through the same
    error scenarios for each of the 4 values.

    Attributes:
        probability: Probability of a qubit being affected in a given moment
        realizations: Number of simulations to create.
        depolarizing_gates: A list of XmonGates to include at every moment.
